# About

I am an applied probabilist working on statistical methodology for networked data sets and their generalizations. My current work focuses on developing scientifically-motivated random graph null models for hypothesis-testing and inference. Two recent highlights include a generalization of configuration models to random hypergraphs and a study of the moments of random multigraphs with fixed degree sequences. I also have active interests in generative models, machine learning, information theory, and spatial analysis. 

I am a passionate educator. Teaching subjects include probability, network science, statistical programming, and applied data analysis at undergraduate and graduate levels. In 2018, I was my department's nominee for MIT's campus-wide Goodwin Award for "conspicuously effective teaching." 

I am a member of MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://www.mit.edu/~orc/) and the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/).  I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Read my full CV [here](https://philchodrow.gitlab.io/cv/cv.pdf).
