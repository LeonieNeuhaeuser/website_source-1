# About

I am an applied mathematician working on methodological problems that arise in the scientific study of complex social systems. My professional philosophy is **math for humans**.

1. Mathematics that *serves the human interest*, by contributing to scientific understandings of peace, conflict, and disparity. Learn more about my research [here](#publications). 
2. Mathematics *communicated humanistically*, in a way that conveys beauty, charm, and power alongside rigor. Learn more about my teaching [here](/#teaching). 

I am a member of  MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://www.mit.edu/~orc/), the [Human Mobility and Networks Lab](http://humnetlab.mit.edu), and the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/).  I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and my work has appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
