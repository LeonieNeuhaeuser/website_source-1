# About


I am an applied mathematician working on bridging gaps between random graph theory and applied network data science. I do this by formulating and analyzing generalized random structures motivated by scientifically natural modeling choices for network data sets. Two recent highlights include a generalization of configuration models to random hypergraphs and a study of the moments of random multigraphs with fixed degree sequences. 

I am a member of  MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://www.mit.edu/~orc/) and the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/).  I am supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Read my full CV [here](https://philchodrow.gitlab.io/cv/cv.pdf).
