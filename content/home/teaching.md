- **Organizer**, Winter 2019: 15.S60, "Computing in Optimization and Statistics." I organize and teach by-researchers-for-researchers sessions on computational tools for contemporary data science. 

You can also read [nice things](/teaching_testimonials) my students have said about me, or view my [complete teaching history](/teaching).
