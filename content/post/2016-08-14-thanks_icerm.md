Last week, Marta and I had the great privilege to serve as group leaders for a team researching spatial crime networks as part of ICERM's workshop on Predictive Policing. We are grateful to ICERM, the Providence Police Department, Jeff Brantingham, Martin Short, and our group -- Haiyan, Chuntian, Matt, and Monica!
