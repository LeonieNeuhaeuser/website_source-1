[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is an authoring tool for easily sharing reproducible data analysis. If you are learning to use R Markdown, you may be interested in my recent [slides](/resources/rmarkdown/rmarkdown.html)  and (download links) [accompanying](/resources/rmarkdown/ex1_skeleton.Rmd) [exercises](/resources/rmarkdown/dash_example.Rmd).
