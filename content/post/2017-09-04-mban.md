[Daisy Zhuo](http://www.mit.edu/~zhuo/) and I had the pleasure last week of leading a day-long session for MIT's Master of Business Analytics students in which we survey a complete, [tidy](https://www.tidyverse.org/) data science workflow for the `R` programming language. If you are interested in a concise introduction to the basics, or can use these materials in your own teaching, please feel free to browse them [here](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/data_science_intro/index.html). Feedback is most welcome!
