On Thursday, Nov. 9th, I'll be giving a talk to the Human Mobility and Networks lab on the elements of ***causal inference***, the statistical toolbox for inferring and quantifying causal relationships between phenomena. While it's easy to take a data set and show, say, that smoking is *correlated* with lung cancer, it's much harder to formulate a testable, mathematical theory to support the claim that smoking *causes* lung cancer. Causal inference, as developed in its most prominent form by Judea Pearl, tackles this challenge through the threefold framework of structural causal modeling; *do*-calculus, and causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). 

My talk on Thursday will briefly motivate and introduce these concepts, and discuss some prospects for the use of causal methods in the context of massive, passively-collected data sets. You can find my slides [here](/pdf/causal_inference.pdf). Feedback is most welcome.
