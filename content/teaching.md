I love sharing mathematics and data science with motivated students, in academia, in industry, and in the nonprofit sector. My recent teaching activities have included courses at MIT, workshops for researchers, and trainings for nonprofits. 

To read nice things my students have said about me, click [here](/teaching_testimonials). 

## 2017

- **Teaching Assistant**: MIT Course 1.204, "Computer Modeling: From Individual Mobility to Networks." I lead a weekly recitation focusing on mathematical and statistical methods used in contemporary research in human behavior, complex systems, and city science. 
- **Organizer:** "Computation in Optimization and Statistics." A four-week, advanced course on computational tools in applied mathematics, statistics, operations research, and computational engineering, offered by and for practicing researchers. All materials from the 2017 edition are available [here](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/).
- **Instructor:** "Advanced Topics in Data Science." A three-hour integrative session on navigating the circle of data science using functional programming in `R`. [Slides](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/4_advanced_topics/slides.html), a [case study](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/4_advanced_topics/notes.html), and [source code](https://github.com/PhilChodrow/cos_2017/tree/master/4_advanced_topics) are all available. 

## 2016

- **Group Co-Leader:** Workshop on Predictive Policing at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, Providence RI.  
- **Nonprofit Analytics Consultant:** A sequence of trainings on data analysis workflows in `R`, quality control in analytics pipelines, and elementary programming concepts for a growing Boston-based nonprofit startup.
