I love sharing mathematics and data science with motivated students, in academia, in industry, and in the nonprofit sector. My recent activities have included courses at MIT, workshops for researchers, and trainings for nonprofit data analysts.

# 2018

- **Head Teaching Assistant:** 6.268, Network Science and Models. I develop course materials, lead recitations, and hold office hours for a graduate-level course in network science. 
- **Organizer:** "Computing in Optimization and Statistics." A four-week, advanced course on computational tools in applied mathematics, statistics, operations research, and computational engineering, offered by and for practicing researchers. All materials from the 2017 edition are available [here](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2018/).
- **Instructor**, Winter 2018: "Advanced Topics in Data Science." I led a session for students at MIT's Master of Business Analytics program on  navigating the circle of data science using functional programming in `R`. [Slides](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2018/4_advanced_topics/slides.html), a [case study](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2018/4_advanced_topics/notes.html), and [source code](https://github.com/PhilChodrow/cos_2018/tree/master/4_advanced_topics) are all available. 

## 2017
- **Teaching Assistant**, 6.041/6.431, Introduction to Probability. I led tutorial sessions, held office hours, and graded exams for an advanced undergraduate/introductory graduate course in probability theory and models. 
- **Instructor**, Fall 2017: Introduction to Data Science in `R`. I led a session in which we go from zero to BI dashboards in three hours for incoming Master of Business Analytics students. Materials [here](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/data_science_intro/index.html). 
- **Invited Seminar Leader**, Summer 2017: Information Theory in Network Science at Northeastern's Network Science Institute. Lecture notes available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07459).
- **Teaching Assistant**: MIT Course 1.204, "Computer Modeling: From Individual Mobility to Networks." I lead a weekly recitation focusing on mathematical and statistical methods used in contemporary research in human behavior, complex systems, and city science. 
- **Organizer:** "Computating in Optimization and Statistics." A four-week, advanced course on computational tools in applied mathematics, statistics, operations research, and computational engineering, offered by and for practicing researchers. All materials from the 2017 edition are available [here](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/).
- **Instructor:** "Advanced Topics in Data Science." A three-hour integrative session on navigating the circle of data science using functional programming in `R`. [Slides](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/4_advanced_topics/slides.html), a [case study](https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/4_advanced_topics/notes.html), and [source code](https://github.com/PhilChodrow/cos_2017/tree/master/4_advanced_topics) are all available. 

## 2016
