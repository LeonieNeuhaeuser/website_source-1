abstract : "We study the expected adjacency matrix of a uniformly random multigraph with fixed degree sequence. This matrix arises in a variety of analyses of networked data sets, including modularity-maximization and mean-field theories of spreading processes. Its structure is well-understood for large, sparse, simple graphs, but many data sets are neither large, sparse, nor simple. In these cases standard approximations no longer apply. We derive a novel estimator using a dynamical approach: the estimator emerges from the stationarity conditions of a class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms for graph sampling. Nonasymptotic error bounds are available under mild assumptions, and the estimator can be computed efficiently. We test the estimator on a small network, finding that it enjoys relative bias against ground truth a full order of magnitude smaller than standard expressions. We then compare modularity maximization techniques using both the standard and novel estimator, finding that the behavior of algorithms depends significantly on the estimator choice. Our results emphasize the importance of using carefully specified random graph models in data scientific applications."
