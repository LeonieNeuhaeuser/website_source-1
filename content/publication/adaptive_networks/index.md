abstract = "'Coevolving' or 'adaptive' voter models (AVMs) are natural systems for modeling the emergence of mesoscopic structure from local networked processes driven by conflict and homophily. Because of this, many methods for approximating the long-run behavior of AVMs have been proposed over the last decade. However, most such methods are either restricted in scope, expensive in computation, or inaccurate in predicting important statistics. In this work, we develop a novel, second-order moment closure approximation method for studying the equilibrium mesoscopic structure of AVMs and apply it to binary-state rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same model variants with random state-switching. This framework exploits an asymmetry in voting events that enables us to derive analytic approximations for the fast-timescale dynamics. The resulting numerical approximations enable the computation of key properties of the model behavior, such as the location of the fragmentation transition and the equilibrium active edge density, across the entire range of state densities. Numerically, they are nearly exact for the rewire-to-random model, and competitive with other current approaches for the rewire-to-same model. We conclude with suggestions for model refinement and extensions to more complex models."
